# SecureMigrantReloc

## Overview

SecureMigrantReloc is a Web3 project built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It provides a decentralized, secure, and transparent system for managing migrant relocations. The platform addresses real-world challenges in migrant relocation processes, such as lack of transparency in fund allocation, identity fraud, unsafe relocation tracking, corruption in aid distribution, and inefficient coordination between governments, NGOs, and communities.

By leveraging blockchain, the project ensures:
- **Immutable Records**: All relocation data, identities, and transactions are stored on-chain for auditability.
- **Secure Identity Verification**: Decentralized identity (DID) integration to prevent fraud.
- **Transparent Funding**: Smart contracts handle donations and disbursements with automated conditions.
- **Safe Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of migrant journeys with geolocation proofs (off-chain oracles can integrate).
- **Governance**: Community and stakeholder voting for relocation decisions.
- **Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive data.

This solves problems like:
- Corruption: Funds are released only upon verifiable milestones (e.g., safe arrival).
- Inefficiency: Automated processes reduce bureaucracy.
- Safety: Verified hosts and routes minimize risks.
- Inclusion: Migrants can participate in decisions via tokenized rights.

The project consists of 6 core smart contracts written in Clarity, deployable on Stacks (Bitcoin-secured blockchain).

## Architecture

The system uses a modular design:
1. **IdentityContract**: Manages decentralized identities for migrants, hosts, and organizations.
2. **RelocationContract**: Handles relocation requests, approvals, and tracking.
3. **FundingContract**: Manages donations, crowdfunding, and conditional disbursements.
4. **GovernanceContract**: Enables voting on policies and specific relocations.
5. **OracleContract**: Integrates external data (e.g., geolocation, verification proofs).
6. **TokenContract**: Issues utility tokens for incentives and access rights.

These contracts interact via cross-contract calls for seamless operation. Users interact via a dApp frontend (not included here, but can be built with React/Web3.js).

## Smart Contracts

Below are the Clarity smart contract definitions. These are functional but simplified for the README. Full implementations would include error handling, events, and optimizations. Deploy them on Stacks using the Clarinet tool.

### 1. IdentityContract.clar
This contract manages verifiable credentials for users (migrants, hosts, NGOs). It uses maps to store hashed identities and supports zero-knowledge verification.

```clarity
(define-trait verifiable-credential-trait
  ((verify (principal buff) (response bool uint))))

(define-map identities principal { hash: buff, verified: bool, role: (string-ascii 32) })

(define-public (register-identity (user principal) (id-hash buff) (role (string-ascii 32)))
  (map-set identities user { hash: id-hash, verified: false, role: role })
  (ok true))

(define-public (verify-identity (user principal) (proof buff))
  ;; Simulate ZK-proof verification (in production, integrate external verifier)
  (let ((entry (unwrap! (map-get? identities user) (err u100))))
    (if (is-eq (hash160 proof) (get hash entry))
      (begin
        (map-set identities user (merge entry { verified: true }))
        (ok true))
      (err u101))))

(define-read-only (get-identity (user principal))
  (map-get? identities user))
```

### 2. RelocationContract.clar
Core contract for submitting, approving, and tracking relocations. It references identities and integrates with funding.

```clarity
(use-trait identity-trait .IdentityContract.verifiable-credential-trait)

(define-map relocations uint { migrant: principal, host: principal, status: (string-ascii 32), start-time: uint, end-time: (optional uint) })
(define-data-var relocation-counter uint u0)

(define-public (submit-relocation (migrant principal) (host principal) (identity-contract <identity-trait>))
  (let ((migrant-entry (try! (contract-call? identity-contract get-identity migrant)))
        (host-entry (try! (contract-call? identity-contract get-identity host))))
    (asserts! (and (get verified migrant-entry) (get verified host-entry)) (err u200))
    (let ((id (var-get relocation-counter)))
      (map-set relocations id { migrant: migrant, host: host, status: "pending", start-time: block-height, end-time: none })
      (var-set relocation-counter (+ id u1))
      (ok id))))

(define-public (approve-relocation (id uint) (approver principal))
  ;; Only authorized roles (e.g., NGO) can approve
  (let ((reloc (unwrap! (map-get? relocations id) (err u201))))
    ;; Role check logic here
    (map-set relocations id (merge reloc { status: "approved" }))
    (ok true)))

(define-public (complete-relocation (id uint) (proof buff))
  (let ((reloc (unwrap! (map-get? relocations id) (err u202))))
    (asserts! (is-eq (get migrant reloc) tx-sender) (err u203))
    ;; Verify proof (e.g., geolocation)
    (map-set relocations id (merge reloc { status: "completed", end-time: (some block-height) }))
    (ok true)))

(define-read-only (get-relocation (id uint))
  (map-get? relocations id))
```

### 3. FundingContract.clar
Handles STX (Stacks token) donations and releases funds based on relocation milestones.

```clarity
(use-trait relocation-trait .RelocationContract.relocation-trait)

(define-map funds uint { relocation-id: uint, total: uint, released: uint, donors: (list 100 principal) })
(define-constant RELEASE_PERCENT u50) ;; 50% on approval, 50% on completion

(define-public (donate (relocation-id uint) (amount uint))
  (try! (stx-transfer? amount tx-sender (as-contract tx-sender)))
  (let ((fund (default-to { relocation-id: relocation-id, total: u0, released: u0, donors: (list) } (map-get? funds relocation-id))))
    (map-set funds relocation-id (merge fund { total: (+ (get total fund) amount), donors: (cons tx-sender (get donors fund)) }))
    (ok true)))

(define-public (release-funds (relocation-id uint) (relocation-contract <relocation-trait>))
  (let ((reloc (try! (contract-call? relocation-contract get-relocation relocation-id)))
        (fund (unwrap! (map-get? funds relocation-id) (err u300))))
    (if (is-eq (get status reloc) "approved")
      (let ((to-release (* (get total fund) RELEASE_PERCENT u100) / u10000))
        (try! (as-contract (stx-transfer? to-release tx-sender (get host reloc))))
        (map-set funds relocation-id (merge fund { released: (+ (get released fund) to-release) }))
        (ok to-release))
      (if (is-eq (get status reloc) "completed")
        (let ((remaining (- (get total fund) (get released fund))))
          (try! (as-contract (stx-transfer? remaining tx-sender (get host reloc))))
          (map-set funds relocation-id (merge fund { released: (get total fund) }))
          (ok remaining))
        (err u301)))))

(define-read-only (get-funds (relocation-id uint))
  (map-get? funds relocation-id))
```

### 4. GovernanceContract.clar
Allows token holders to vote on relocations or policies.

```clarity
(use-trait token-trait .TokenContract.ft-trait)

(define-map proposals uint { description: (string-ascii 256), votes-for: uint, votes-against: uint, end-time: uint })
(define-data-var proposal-counter uint u0)

(define-public (create-proposal (description (string-ascii 256)) (duration uint) (token-contract <token-trait>))
  (let ((balance (try! (contract-call? token-contract ft-balance-of tx-sender))))
    (asserts! (> balance u0) (err u400))
    (let ((id (var-get proposal-counter)))
      (map-set proposals id { description: description, votes-for: u0, votes-against: u0, end-time: (+ block-height duration) })
      (var-set proposal-counter (+ id u1))
      (ok id))))

(define-public (vote (proposal-id uint) (vote bool) (token-contract <token-trait>))
  (let ((prop (unwrap! (map-get? proposals proposal-id) (err u401)))
        (balance (try! (contract-call? token-contract ft-balance-of tx-sender))))
    (asserts! (< block-height (get end-time prop)) (err u402))
    (if vote
      (map-set proposals proposal-id (merge prop { votes-for: (+ (get votes-for prop) balance) }))
      (map-set proposals proposal-id (merge prop { votes-against: (+ (get votes-against prop) balance) })))
    (ok true)))

(define-read-only (get-proposal (id uint))
  (map-get? proposals id))
```

### 5. OracleContract.clar
Provides external data feeds (e.g., for geolocation or identity proofs). In practice, this would integrate with trusted oracles.

```clarity
(define-map oracle-data (string-ascii 32) buff)
(define-constant ORACLE_ADMIN 'SP000000000000000000002Q6VF78) ;; Example principal

(define-public (submit-data (key (string-ascii 32)) (value buff))
  (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender ORACLE_ADMIN) (err u500))
  (map-set oracle-data key value)
  (ok true))

(define-read-only (get-data (key (string-ascii 32)))
  (map-get? oracle-data key))
```

### 6. TokenContract.clar
Fungible token (FT) for incentives, governance, and access.

```clarity
(define-fungible-token reloc-token u100000000)
(define-constant ADMIN 'SP000000000000000000002Q6VF78)

(define-public (mint (amount uint) (recipient principal))
  (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender ADMIN) (err u600))
  (ft-mint? reloc-token amount recipient))

(define-public (transfer (amount uint) (sender principal) (recipient principal))
  (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender sender) (err u601))
  (ft-transfer? reloc-token amount sender recipient))

(define-read-only (ft-balance-of (user principal))
  (ft-get-balance reloc-token user))
```
